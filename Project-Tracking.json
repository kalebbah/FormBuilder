    "Description": "An internal web application for designing and managing digital forms and multi-step workflows. It enables non-technical staff to build forms (with rich field types and conditional logic) and define workflow processes for form approvals and task routing. The goal is to replace paper forms and manual processes with a unified platform, improving efficiency and providing an audit trail for all organizational tasks.",

        "DragAndDropUI": "Admins can add form fields by dragging field types (text, number, date, dropdown, checkbox, photo upload, signature, etc.) onto a form canvas and rearrange them visually.",
        "ConditionalLogic": "Support conditional logic to show/hide fields or sections based on user input (e.g., if Field A = X, then reveal Field B). This enables dynamic, responsive forms and branching paths within a form.",
        "FieldValidation": "Allow setting validation rules for fields (required, min/max, regex pattern, etc.) and formula calculations for derived values (e.g., auto-calculate totals).",
        "CustomComponents": "Include support for specialized field types like signature capture, photo upload (with camera support), barcode/QR code scanning, NFC tag reading, geolocation fields, and even OCR (text recognition from images). This broad range of components will cover many data capture needs (though some advanced inputs might be phased in over time).",
        "FormTemplates": "Option to save form designs as templates for reuse or to jump-start new forms.",
        "OutputDefinition": "Form definitions are stored in the database (e.g., as a JSON schema) representing all fields, layout, and logic. This JSON-driven approach allows the form renderer to dynamically generate the form UI for users.",
        "FormSubmission": "Users can fill out published forms via a generated UI. On submission, the data is validated and saved to the database, and can trigger a workflow if one is associated with that form. The submitted data is stored (likely as JSON or in a structured table) for record-keeping and further processing.",

      "WorkflowEngine": {
        "Purpose": "Enable design and execution of multi-step workflows that route form submissions through various stages (e.g., approvals, reviews) and different users, creating an auditable process flow.",
        "VisualDesigner": "Provide a visual drag-and-drop workflow designer for SuperAdmins to define workflows. The designer will allow placing and connecting workflow components (steps) such as form tasks, approval tasks, notifications, decision branches, etc., forming a flowchart of the process.",
        "WorkflowDefinition": "Each workflow consists of a sequence of steps (which can branch or run in parallel). The system should support sequential flows and parallel branches (forks/joins) similar to modern workflow/BPM engines. For example, a workflow might start with a form submission, then fork into multiple approval tasks in parallel, and join back when all approvals are complete.",
        "StepTypes": "Supported step types may include: Form Task (assign a form to a user or role to fill out or review), Approval/Review (user approves or rejects a submission), Notification (send an email or alert), Branching Condition (if X then path A else path B), Parallel Fork and Join for concurrent tasks, and an End step. Each step will have configurable parameters (e.g., which form to open, who to assign, what condition to evaluate).",
        "Assignments": "Workflows can assign tasks to specific users, roles, or groups. For instance, an approval step could route to the submitter's manager or a specific role like 'Warehouse Manager'. The ability to target individuals or groups ensures the workflow can mirror organizational processes.",
        "WorkflowTriggers": "A workflow can be associated with a form (or multiple forms). When a user submits that form, an instance of the workflow is initiated, carrying the form submission data into it. Alternatively, workflows could be started manually or on a schedule (future capability, e.g., cron-based triggers, though not in initial scope).",
        "StateTracking": "Each running workflow (workflow instance) will maintain state of which step is currently active and who has the task. The system should track progress so that if a user completes their task, the workflow moves to the next step. Long-running workflows (spanning days or weeks waiting for approvals) are supported by persisting state in the database, so that the process can survive restarts and can be monitored.",
        "AuditTrail": "Every action in a workflow (form submission, task assignment, approval decision, etc.) is logged with timestamp and user info, creating an audit trail for compliance and review. Users with appropriate roles can view the history of a workflow instance to see what happened at each step (who did what, when).",
        "Notifications": "When a task is assigned to a user via the workflow, the system can send an email notification to that user (with a link to the application) to alert them of the new task. This ensures timely attention to tasks. In the future, real-time in-app notifications or push notifications could be added for immediate alerts.",
        "WorkflowStatus": "Provide visibility into workflow instances: e.g., an admin can see that a particular submission is 'Pending Manager Approval' or 'Completed'. This status is determined by which step is active. If workflows are complex, a visual representation of the instance's progress (highlighting current step) could be provided in the UI for tracking.",

E.g., form builder endpoints require Admin or SuperAdmin, workflow designer requires SuperAdmin, regular users can only access form submission and their tasks. This ensures users only see and do what their role permits.",
      "DataSecurity": "Use HTTPS for all communication. Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. Server-side validation for all form inputs (in addition to client-side) to prevent malicious data. Audit logs as mentioned provide accountability. Also, implement proper error handling to avoid information leaks.

Fields might include FormID, title/name, JSON definition (containing field list, layout, conditional logic), createdBy (admin user), createdDate, etc. Possibly a flag for active/published status. If not storing definition as JSON, could have related tables like FormFields, but JSON is more flexible.",
      "FormSubmissions": "Stores submitted form entries. Each record links to a FormID and the user who submitted.

Also store timestamp of submission and status (e.g., 'In Progress' if it's tied to a workflow, or 'Completed').",
      "Workflows": "Stores workflow definitions (the templates). Fields: WorkflowID, name, definition (possibly JSON or a set of normalized tables representing steps and transitions), createdBy, etc. If using JSON, it would list steps and connections between them. If using tables: separate tables for WorkflowSteps, WorkflowTransitions, etc.",
      "WorkflowInstances": "Tracks each running instance of a workflow. Fields: InstanceID, WorkflowID (link to definition), startedBy (user who triggered via form), startDate, currentStep, status (e.g., 'Active', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'). Possibly store a history log or link to a log table of events.",
      "Tasks": "Stores individual tasks for users that come out of workflows. Fields: TaskID, InstanceID (the workflow instance), StepID (which step this task corresponds to, or a reference to a step definition), assignedTo (user or role), assignedDate, completedDate, status (Pending, Completed, Approved/Rejected if applicable). This table allows a user (or a query) to see all tasks assigned to them. Completing a task will update this record and trigger the workflow engine to proceed.",
      "AuditLogs": "Although each entity above may have its own audit trail, a central AuditLogs table could record events like 'Form X submitted by User Y at time Z', 'Task A approved by Manager at time T', etc. Fields: LogID, timestamp, user, actionType, entityType (form, workflow, task), entityId, description.

The Controllers expose endpoints for form management (CRUD forms, get forms, submit form), workflow management (define workflows, start workflows, get tasks, etc.), user management, etc. Business logic is in Services (e.g., FormService, WorkflowService) which handle validations and workflow state transitions. Entity Framework Core is used for data access to SQL Server, mapping C# models to database tables.",
      "Frontend": "React application (created with create-react-app or similar) structured into pages and components. It will use state management (could be Redux or React Context) for managing user session and perhaps form builder state. Key UI components include: Form Builder UI (drag & drop interface to construct forms), Form Renderer (to display a form for input based on definition), Workflow Designer UI (drag & drop canvas for workflows), Task List/Inbox for users, Admin dashboards. The frontend communicates with the backend via asynchronous HTTP calls (using fetch/axios). Authentication may use JWT tokens stored securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies or in memory) for API calls.",
      "RealTimeUpdates": "Initially, the system can use simple polling or page refresh to update task lists and statuses. In the future, we might integrate WebSockets or SignalR for real-time notifications (for example, to alert a user immediately when a new task is assigned). But this is optional for MVP, given email notifications are in place.",
      "Integrations": "The system is built to be extensible. For instance, adding Azure AD authentication will involve integrating with Microsoft identity platform. Other potential integrations: sending emails via SMTP or a service like SendGrid from the backend for notifications; integrating with external APIs (maybe to pull data into forms or push completed data out). These can be added via service classes or Azure Functions, etc., without major changes to form/workflow core logic.",

      "DockerCompose": "For development and testing, a docker-compose configuration will define services: the backend API, the frontend (if served separately), and a SQL Server database (using Microsoft's official SQL Server Linux container image). This allows one-command startup of the whole system for developers or automated tests.",

Data persists in the SQL Server database container (or an external SQL Server instance). Regular backups of the database are essential.

Logging and monitoring can be set up via container logs or adding tools like Elastic Stack in the future.",
